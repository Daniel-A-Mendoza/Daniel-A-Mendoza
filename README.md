# Hi there 👋
My name is **Daniel Mendoza**.

I'm a Computer Science student with interests in Machine Learning, Web Development, and Databased.

🔭 I'm currently working on a personal attendance tracking project to practice web and app development.

🌱 I’m currently learning R and how to use statistics to help create Machine Learning models relevant to a
a specific topic.

💬 Ask me about Java, Data Structures, and Algorithms.

🧐 If I'm stuck, I love researching about my problems through Youtube, AI, and Peers!

⚡ Fun fact: I love learning languages. Currently I'm trying to learn Japanese.
